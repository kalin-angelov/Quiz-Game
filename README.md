#Quiz!

This fun little game was inspired and created for my family, since we always love to test out our basic knowledge every time we sit on the table. So i decided to create this mini app using the newly learned knowledge about the library `react`.

![Screenshot mobile]("./public/screenshot/screenshot-mobile.png")

##The app is created with:

- `React`
